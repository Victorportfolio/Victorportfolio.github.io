                    <p>Coming into AP Language and Composition in the beginning of year I was both confident and prepared in what to expect for this class. I thought after doing the summer reading and taking from what I learned last year, I could easily pass the class, but boy was I wrong. The beginning of the year kicked my butt. I struggled to analyze essays, and barely got my assignments turned in. Going through the struggle I realized AP was not going to be as easy as I thought. With that said, I didn’t come into realization of my failures until the second time I failed the monthly reading exam. From there on, I took some of the lessons in English to heart and studies the lessons. Throughout the year I improved my skills analyzing pieces of writing, and improved my writing score from an average of a 3 to a 6.</p>
                    
                    <p>As we moved from the beginning of the year to the end, I was able to improve my reading score by getting into a habit of always being around the articles on the AP test. Every monthly test we did throughout the year allowed me to be accustomed to what the questions and passages looked like. From there on I continued to look for the rhetorical appeals as well as analyzing SOAPStone. As we did it more and more every little thing became easier for me, and in time I was even able to improve my speed. Then taking a look at writing essays, I did not get a real grasp of it until near the end of the year. The most difficult part was being under pressure as we were taught to outline out our ideas, before we took to drafting. The same improvement of constantly writing helped, but as it came to writing for the AP Test, going over the Toulmin model really advanced my skill. However, I always tried to remind myself of using the rhetorical appeals every time I wrote, especially in persuasive writings.

                    <p>Going from not knowing a thing at all to being able to write an 8 on an essay is an amazing feat. In the beginning of the year I was struggling to even come up with a good outline. In The Myth of the Latin Women analysis, I wrote four paragraphs without touching base with the rhetorical appeals at all. Heck, I was even wondering why I got a three on a paper that I didn’t even bother to outline. My first few monthly assessments came back with 18 and 20 questions correct. From there, I moved onto only missing 10 questions on a timed reading exam. AP Lang came up for me as the looming figure of doom, with me being unable to see past the shadow it casted. As I trained through the year biting nails and forcing myself to look over AP problems, I was able to achieve the almost David and Goliath like story where I defeated the giant monster. Importantly, I was also able to get a good grade out of it.</p>

                    <p>English taught me a lot. Looking at me test scores I have physical proof of achievement. I have living records of low scores followed by what seem as mythical 7’s on a time writing exam. From my first essay to my last, I was able to go through each and every step without skipping a beat. I was able to defeat my feeling of not being able to pass AP, and actually get by with a good grade. Near the end I felt confident turning every page, moving onto the next to question, while analyzing the next passage. Nothing in the class or on the test could defeat me, and if I ever felt down, I might as well just go back and look at the progress I made throughout the year.</p>
    
                    <p>As the year ends with me feeling confident as a student in the English language, I want to reflect on the past assignments we done. Some of my favorite assignments were the creative writings. I enjoyed the freedom to write whatever we want, and with that I was able to just go off alone on the page. For next year I would like to improve my writing even more. Even though I was able to achieve my goals this year, I still have higher goals set next year, and hopefully after conquering those, I am able to find success outside of school.

                            <h2>The Myth of the Latin Women Analysis</h2>

                            <p>Different races come with different stereotypes, and most of us do not even give a person a chance, instead we just assume the presumptions that are asserted with that person's race. In The Myth of the Latin Women, author Judith Ortiz Cofer specifically addresses how people stereotyped her. Growing up as a Latina, no matter what she did to try to fit in with American culture, she always stood out because of Latin traditions and culture. She mentions that no matter how far away she was from Puerto Rico, “the Island traveled with her”. Through narration  and cause and effect, Cofer is able to display the hardships she endured growing up as a Latin American child.</p>
                            
                            <p>Judith Ortiz Cofer is effectively able to use narration throughout her essay to help illustrate her experiences being a Latina living in America. Her narration gives intuition about all the stereotypes she had to fight, how she grew up around Latin culture, and it gives a way for the reader to understand what viewpoints the author comes from. She describes instances like,  “With both hands over his heart he broke into an Irish tenor's rendition of "Maria" from West Side Story.”, Cofer tells about experiences like this in which she was singled out, and then follows up with “the same things can make you an island—not so much a tropical paradise as an Alcatraz, a place where nobody wants to visit” to show how specifically she felt during these awkward encounters. This one instance was not the only time a man confronted her, and because of her being a Latin American women, men are always coming up and hitting on the “hot tamale”  or “sexual firebrand” that is set in the minds of Americans when they think of Latin American women.  Through narration Ortiz is also able to give visions of her past by telling about how she grew up in Puerto Rico and how it was growing up around specific traditions, “As a girl, I was kept under strict surveillance by my parents, since my virtue and modesty were, by their cultural equation, the same as their honor” , in this specific instance she describes how having Latino parents differed from having American parents, and how the culture clash affected her growing up. This means that her parents, growing up around Latin culture, and not understanding American customs,  always had a say in what she did, and for example how she dressed. </p>
                           
                            <p>Cause and effect is another device used in this essay to show the culture clash between the ways of life. Cofer tells us about how, in Puerto Rico girls were influenced on how to dressed by their mothers and on how the warm island’s, “natural environment was a riot of primary colors”. Latin American women dressed jazzy, and wore short skirts to keep cool. The flashy colors always contrasted with what girls wore in the States,  and made Latinas stand out against  the “pale pink” most American girls wore.  Cofer even had a friend that tell her that at school  “Puerto Rican girls always stood out for wearing "everything at once.”  “The way our teachers and classmates looked at us that day in school was just a taste of the cultural clash that awaited us in the real world,” told Cofer not only did she look weird among her classmates, but even to the teachers, who should be mature adults, the way she dressed made her look like an outcast. These stereotypes follow Latinas  all the way to their adult lives as “prospective employers and men on the street would often misinterpret our tight skirts and jingling bracelets as a “come-on”.  This poses a lot of problems in the workplace as bosses disrespectfully talk to Latin women as if they only understood “sexual innuendo” , and often the women would have to withstand the harassment so that they wouldn’t lose their jobs.</p>
                            
                            <p>Judith Ortiz Cofer gives personal experiences of being a Latina in America through narration, while showing the difference of the two cultures using cause and effect. She shows the culture shock of being a young Latina girl growing up in the United States, and the stereotypes of being a woman, all through her perspective. Cofer addresses how Latinas are perceived, and tries to advert the myths that come with being a Latin women. She tries to show the world that how foolish it is to judge a whole race of women based on stereotypes that have been overstretched and developed by media.</p>

                            <p><em>(In one of my first anaylsis essays, "The Myth of the Latin Women" I had a tough time trying to develop and get to my point. I was unorganized throughout the essay, which also came from just not being able to understand the more difficult text back when I first started. Although I was able to point out techniques like cause and effect, I wasen't able to use examples to relate to the audience.)</em> </p>

                            <p>Thousands of mad-driven, die-hard fans march into Seattle’s CenturyLink Field Sunday night wearing blue and green getting ready to cheer on their team from the sidelines. With the roar of nearly 47,000 fans in attendance, the noise level could be heard for miles and miles outside of the stadium. The surprise is that these fans were not there for the hometown champion NFL team, the Seattle Seahawks, but instead for a different kind of “football”. They were there to cheer on the local soccer team, the Seattle Sounders, as they were pitted against the Los Angeles Galaxy in a fight to keep their season alive. With record attendance throughout the 2014 MLS season, and the spread of fever throughout the summer, there is no denying the fact that, soccer, a sport in once nobody knew about in the US, is having its moment, and is on it’s way to taking a place as one of the most beloved sports in American culture.</p>
                            
                            <p>Over the summer, a record breaking 24.7 million people tuned in for the U.S Men's National team game against Portugal in the World Cup, with 18 million of those people watching on ESPN alone. This broke the record of a nationally televised soccer game, and in fact have even surpassed the numbers drawn by the NBA Finals or the Stanley Cup finals. In each game an estimated of 20,000 American fans attended, and around 200,000 American fans bought tickets throughout the World Cup, leading to the U.S having bought the second most tickets out of thirty-two countries. Then in Michigan, 110,000 people poured into Michigan Stadium to watch a star filled match against two huge international teams, Real Madrid vs Manchester United. This match broke records, as this was the highest attended match in the United States ever, and proved to the rest of the world that soccer fever is a disease that thrives in the U.S, and without any sort of cure. About 917,000 people tune into the weekly English Premiere League matches shown by NBC, with advertising campaigns going up by 93% for matches each week.</p>
                            
                            <p>Shifting the scene to Major League Soccer, the U.S’ domestic league, the Sounders being one of the most beloved teams in the MLS, and having stars like Clint Dempsey and Deandre Yedlin, average about 43,000 fans per game and even have had record breaking attendance set over 60,000 fans a game. The Sounders are not the only ones breaking records when it comes to people showing up to cheer on the team, but small clubs like Toronto FC have increased from 18,000 to 22,000 fans as they begin on renovations for the stadium to increase the capacity to 30,000. Also the value of each team has spiked up. In which once an MLS team was worth an average of $37 million, the average is now $107 million.  TV networks are beginning to see the interest of fans in the United States and are handing out major deals to Major League Soccer to broadcast the sport. Recently, a new deal has been reached with ESPN, Fox, and Univision that will bring in a total of $720 million to the MLS. The league has seen a viewer growth of 60% throughout the season, and can only expect more success in the future.</p>
                            
                            <p>With how much publicity the league has gotten over the year, there have been more deals involving the expansion. The two newest additions to the league, set to play in 2015 and 2016 are Orlando City, and newly planned powerhouse New York FC, who are owned by the champion Barclay Premier League Team, Manchester City. Both teams include major international signings of superstars like Kaka, David Villa, and Frank Lampard. These teams have already sold a combined 10,500 season tickets, without ever even playing a game yet. Even more teams are planned to come into the league by 2017, with planned cities such as Sacramento, Las Vegas and Detroit.</p> 
                            
                            <p>As leagues expand and soccer continues to linger on American interests, the quality of soccer in the U.S has gotten better. Players like Clint Dempsey are proven international superstars who are known as elites in the positions they play throughout the world. Young players like Deandre Yedlin and Julian Green are sought out by international powerhouses across Europe. With a lot of American players finding success in the BPL, arguably the best league in the world, international teams like Liverpool, and Bayern Munich have not only shown interest in young American athletes, but also have some in their rosters. With Jurgen Klinsmann coaching the U.S National Men's soccer team, the international team shows an immense amount of potential to grow, being already a well respected team after the 2014 World Cup. Programs around the nation have millions of kids playing soccer, and now that soccer is more of a well known sport, more children are more likely to grow up with soccer being their first love.</p>
                            
                            <p>After the outstanding support for the U.S Men's National Team in the summer, the soccer fervor will go onto linger forever in the United States. More and people are coming to recognize soccer, and as the new generation grows up, they will come to know as soccer being one of the major sports in their lives. All the campaigns produced by major leagues have proven to have effect on the people, and Fifa 15 a soccer game created by EA has even grown to become be one of the best selling games in America. The major sports known in the U.S right now are basketball, football, hockey, and baseball, but with a budding audience, and an abundance of room to grow, soccer has the possibility to take over one of the sports in the “major four”, or even make it “the top five sports in the U.S”.

                            <p><em>(My second essay was one that I did for the Scholastic Writing Contest, and I am actually very proud of it as it did take home an award. "The National Spread of Soccer Fever" was an article recapping the World Cup fever from summer of 2014, and how it boosted soccer as a sport in the U.S. I did a great job of using facts and statistics to back my argument of soccer becoming a legitimate contender for stealing away fans from the major domestic sports, but I could have appealed to emotions a bit more. For example I could have mentioned why soccer is becoming big in the hearts of Americans, and how so many fans feel about it)</em> </p>

                            <h2>The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo Analysis</h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <img src="img/portfolio/essay.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>Stieg Larsson, a political journalist, and founder of Expo a research group that purely focuses on extreme-right hate groups, shines the light of the unethical characteristics in such organizations in “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo”. In his arguably most famous work, he tells the story of Mikael Blomkvist, a reporter whose life goal is to expose corruption, and his quest to restore his good name and will stop at nothing until he completes the task. Blomkvist works closely with Lisbeth Salander, a girl that is deemed unworthy by the society around, on a mysterious freelance job tasked by Henrik Vanger. Throughout the story, Blomkvist takes to extreme measure, abandoning his old moral ethics, and integrity, while taking life-threatening risks to restore his credibility, and ultimately saving his magazine firm, the “Millennium”. Taking a deeper look into this mystery-thriller, “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo” expresses the themes of corruption, violence against women, and the common misinterpretation based on the appearance of someone else.</p>
                            
                            <p>The story opens up and immediately establishes the theme of corruption, as Blomkvist is being accused of ruining Wennerstrom’s character and Blomkvist is charged with three months of prison. Wennerstrom, a corrupt international financier and businessman continuously lives above the law, as he holds a firm grip on the financial and economic side of things. He holds multiple bank accounts, and has an immense amount of money which allows him to control what is going on around him, for example Mikael Blomkvist’s court trial. “There are only fantasies in which people from one hour to the next decide that this or that company is worth so many billions, more or less. It doesn’t have a thing to do with reality or with the Swedish economy.” shows the Swedish economy, and hints at how people like Vanger and Wennerstrom rose to power. Another form of corruption in “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo” is also moral and ethical corruption. A major example of this is the whole Vanger family itself. Martin Vanger, ironically the head of his company, stems from a family of alcoholics, rapists, and murderers, while also concealing his own sins and unethical business practices himself. Although the Vangers seem like practical and wealthy businessmen, they hide darker and more abysmal side to them as their luxurious estate serves as a profound symbol to help characterize the broken family. Another instance of moral corruption can be found when Salander was raped by her own trusted guardian. Ordered by the court to protect her, Salander’s guardian, Nils Bjurman,  took advantage of her, forcing sexual favors upon Salander until she stood up for herself, ultimately torturing Bjurman.</p>
                            
                            <p>The most evident theme in “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo” is the issue of violence against women. “In her world, this was the natural order of things. As a girl she was legal prey, especially if she was dressed in a worn black leather jacket and had pierced eyebrows, tattoos, and zero social status.” was said by Salander’s guardian about her, and shows how girls are seen in Sweden. Throughout the novel women are portrayed as inferior, and powerless against men, except from Salander’s point of view. Martin and Gottfried Vanger brutally show their hatred toward women, and justify them with their beliefs in the bible, convincing themselves that women are disgusting and desperate individuals in need of punishment. Mostly all the violence in this novel are geared towards females, as each victims of the serial killers are girls, and are plotted based on how powerless they seem in society.  One of the most graphic scenes in the novel was the instance where Lisbeth Salander is brutally raped by Bjurman, her guardian, and Salander is forced to take action herself. Salander comes to the conclusion that the mistreatment of women in Sweden is a common thing, and that officials will rarely act on any charges because it is accepted throughout society. As the plot progresses even Wennerstrom is found out of having forced an abortion onto a women by threatening her own life. Salander acts as a beacon of hope for abused women as she proves that she is able to act independently, and also able to get back at those who have hurt her. She also rebels against the Vangers’ belief and tells Blomkvist, “I think you’re wrong. It’s not an insane serial killer who read his Bible wrong. It’s just a common or garden bastard who hates women”. She tosses the stereotypical idea of women being powerless out the window, and  instead of acting as a poor victim she fiercely takes action, and holds the strong belief  for females to empower themselves.</p>
                            
                            <p>Throughout the story, the old saying of “don’t judge a book by it’s cover” is commonly being enforced from beginning to end. Despite the way Salander dresses, and how she appears, Salander is constantly defying the expectations her boss, and proves her capability of functioning in a society. Also despite being being a women, and the social belief that she is surrounded by, she is strong and independent, proving that she does not need the protection of others, and that she is more than capable of taking care of herself. Without her intelligence, and her strength, Blomkvist would have never been able to crack Vanger’s case. The quote “Everyone has secrets. It's just a matter of finding out what they are.” describes the antagonist, Vanger, perfectly as the way he projects himself in public, is different from how he actually is. Martin Vanger, may seem like a person who seems completely normal except for his immense amount of wealth on the outside, turns out to be a person completely opposite. Based on how he conducts himself with others, nobody would have been ever able to think that Vanger was a rapist and a killer. The house he lives in suggests the same irony as it may seem beautiful and elegant on the outside, but inside houses a sadistic dungeon used to torture victims, and conceal murders. Blomkvist himself can also be seen as someone who has been misjudged as he tried to report against the corruption of Wennerstrom. After the trial, Blomkvist was thought of a liar, and as someone who tried to bring an innocent businessman to his downfall. Ironically as Blomkvist tried to expose the truth, it was his name and company that took the downfall for Wennerstrom’s crimes.</p> 
                            
                            <p>“The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo” accurately depicts the scene of our society today. Blatant racism and prejudice are seen throughout our world, and everyday on the news. The Vangers, and Wennerstrom are a symbol of how the white privileged society is able and feast on the poor, and the graphic scenes are a representation of the abusive nature of these type of men. Corruption is often seen throughout history and now, especially in political terms, as most corruption stems from money. Blomkvist’s trial was a clear showing of how Wennerstrom’s wealth was able to turn the tides of an innocent man trying to expose the truth, and the power of corruption in society. This novel can also be seen as a strong feminist message to women as Lisbeth Salander is shown as a strong female character able to not only hold her own, but bring down corrupt men in a world where she is seen as useless and weak. She conveys the message of feminist strength to women around the world, and could be seen as a role model as she overcomes adversity, and her discriminatory role as a “victim”, to help Blomkvist take down Vanger and Wennerstrom, ultimately building a strong relationship with him. “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo” may be seen as a crime/thriller type of novel, but actually houses many messages to show to the world, about the dark sides of what can be seen as a perfect society.</p>

                            <p><em>(Going back into writing another analysis, "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" was the book I chose for my outside reading project. This time I had done a pretty good overall job recapping the events and talking about the themes inside the book. I had used settings from inside the books to illustrate each individual message, and theme. What I could have done better was use more in-text citations to show the dialogue, and also engage the audience more when I introduced my themes.)</em> </p>

                            <h2>Blog Project</h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <img src="img/portfolio/essay.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>Torture, murder, zombies, aliens, and psychotic villains. All of those things are somewhat involved in the plot of a convoluted story that’s set in the the realm of a horror film. A horror movie is meant to be an exhilarating ride that puts you on the edge of your seat for about two whole hours, without giving the audience a single second of breathing room for recovery. But that’s the problem these days, usually when I watch a horror film, I’m never frightened, never tense, and certainly I don’t feel anything for the story.  Did I miss my ride on the magnificent roller coaster as I sit there witnessing these fans freaking about some stupid monster woven into a dumb plot that a couple of film producers are trying to sell?</p>

                            <p>In a horror movie there is nothing left to the imagination anymore. That or a film’s cheap effects dull your mind so you can’t think. One of the main problems in a scary movie nowadays are the lousy gimmicks used at every single turn. For example, jump scares. I don’t think the idea of horror still stands as what it once meant. Now, the idea of something being scary involves loud noises every other minute, and for some reason movie-goers still get tricked into falling for it.</p>

                            <p>There isn’t anything difficult about using a technique like the jump scare. Dim the lights, stop the music, and have the character turn the corner. It had me after the tenth time it was used in the same movie, and to any reasonably minded individual it would have them after the eighth time. The problem with the jump scare is that it is used so much now. If you weren’t already expecting it going into the movie, you’ll certainly expect it near the end of the movie where the scariest parts are shown. Jump scares are used so often that we forget what is actually scary, but how foolish do directors think we really are? Would we really fall for the same trap over and over again? Oh wait, Ouija did make more money than Nightcrawler and John Wick last fall…</p>

                            <p>Lets not place all the blame on poor directing though. Sometimes its the marketing that ruins a good movie. Usually when making a trailer, you want to create a huge buzz, and appeal to as much of an audience as you can. So to try to get people to watch, some movies are turned into these creature features, where throughout the trailer they show the monster, and only the monster.</p>

                            <p>A movie that experienced this pitfall was The Village directed by M. Night Shyamalan. Instead of the movie telling the tale of a distorted monster like the trailer promised, the actual story and the twist in the plot was not really about a monster at all. Poor marketing lead to the downfall of the movie having everyone rip it to shreds, while years later, people finally see it for what its worth.</p>

                            <p>In my opinion, gravitating towards something in the a Psychological Thriller genre is much more appealing. A psych thriller gives the viewer a lot of room to think, and the imagination can spark amazing amounts of different conclusions. Those sorts of movies stick with you longer than any sort of failed creature feature as your brain works to resolve the action on the screen, while telling itself to check your closet before you go to sleep.</p>

                            <p>Hopefully the cinema can come to realization and bring the concept of true horror back. Take a look at The Babadook. The movie tells the story of a mother and her son going through the dreadful symptoms of depression. Symbols are used throughout the whole film as beacons for their downfall. Isn’t that idea, a single heart-broken mother losing grasp of the world around her, while not being able to find the strength to care for her son, a more gut wrenching story to watch rather than a film meant to startle you with jump scares? The Babadook makes you wonder, and realize what the monster actually is, and how close at home it may be for some.</p>

                            <p>In fact, maybe somehow establishing a connection is needed these days, but if anything, the industry of horror films need something to help recapture the magic it once contained.</p>

                            <p><em>(Our last few assignments were dedicated to our blogs. When we wrote on our blogs we certainly want to appeal to the audience because the success of our blog is dependent on the interest of the audience. In this one piece I incorporated diction to appeal the the audience, and relevant examples to find common ground with the audience.)</em>
